DirectoryScan
=============

This helps you scan through a number of directories within the specified directory to scan all the respective files with a given extension and output the string to be searched.
For example within directory A, a number of other directories like B, C, D,...are present and within B other directories like a,b,c.. are present. The presented code will scan through all directories starting from the root directory and then move forward. A given file extension is also specified. So all the files with that extension are stored in an array and consumed for further use.
The string that need to be searched in all the files is specified by user.
If the string matches any of the present files then the counter is incremented and at the same time the file name is output on the screen.
Thus, multi directory search is carried out, then each file with specified extension is stored and the user specified string is then scanned through all these files and accordingly the corresponding file is output.
